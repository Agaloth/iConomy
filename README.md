# iConomy 5

The original iConomy 5 plugin revamped and updated.

This plugin requires Vault, Towny and TownyNameUpdater. Town and Nation bank accounts will not reset using this economy plugin.

Conversion from Essentials Eco can be done running the command /icoimport from the server console.

Other economy plugins can be converted to Essentials Economy using the ess eco /baltop command, and then converted to iConomy using the above command.
